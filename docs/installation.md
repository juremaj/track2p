# Installation
### --- UNDER CONSTRUCTION ---


### Platform specific installation issues/requirements:
**MacOS**: You might need to have xcode enabled during installation. If you run into `xcrun: error: invalid active developer path .../.../... , missing xcrun at .../.../... ` then enable xcode by running: `xcode-select --install`

**Linux Ubuntu**: Everything works well.

**Windows**: (not tested yet)
