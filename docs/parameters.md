## Setting up `run_track2p.py`

`run_track2p.py` script in the root of the directory and specifies:

- `track_ops.all_ds_path`: list of paths to datasets containing a `suite2p` folder (see [suite2p datasets]( https://github.com/juremaj/track2p/blob/main/docs/gui.md#suite2p-dataset-organization))
- `track_ops.save_path`: where the outputs will be saved (a `track2p` folder will be generated here)
-  `track_ops.colors`: It's a color vector assigning a specific color to each cell. When the user opens a track2Pp dataset, each cell retains the same color at each opening.
A vector is created per plane `colors_plane_x`
  
- `track_ops.save_in_s2p_format` :  allows to generate the suite2p files containing only the cells present on every day (see [matched_suite2p](https://github.com/juremaj/track2p/blob/main/docs/gui.md#run-track2p))
- `track_ops.vector_curation` : It is a vector of the length of the number of cells found every day by our algorithm. It represents the state of each cell, varying between 0 and 1, where 0 means that it is considered "not cell" by the user, and 1 means that it is recognized as a "cell". It is appallingly updated by the userâ€™s choice. 
A vector is created per plane `vector_curation_plane_x`
  (see [curation](https://github.com/juremaj/track2p/blob/main/docs/gui.md](https://github.com/juremaj/track2p/blob/main/docs/gui.md)))


(for basic documentation see comments in `track2p/ops/default.py`, more documentation will be added soon).
