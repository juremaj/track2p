## Setting up `run_track2p.py`

`run_track2p.py` script in the root of the directory and specifies:

- `track_ops.all_ds_path`: list of paths to datasets containing a `suite2p` folder
- `track_ops.save_path`: where the outputs will be saved (a `track2p` folder will be generated here)
- `track_ops.save_in_s2p_format` :  allows to generate the suite2p files containing only the cells present on every day 
-
  
   (for basic documentation see comments in `track2p/ops/default.py`, more documentation will be added soon).
